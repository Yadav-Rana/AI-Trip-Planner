# 1.2 Project Overview/Specifications

"Trip Planner" is an AI-powered travel planning platform designed to streamline trip organization for travelers. Unlike traditional travel platforms that operate on a large scale, Trip Planner focuses on creating a more personalized, user-friendly experience. The platform serves two key user roles: travelers and administrators.

## User Roles

### Travelers

Travelers can easily create personalized itineraries with AI-powered recommendations and detailed cost estimates. They can view destination information, track their trip history, and rate their experience after each journey. The platform ensures security through user authentication and maintains transparency in cost calculations. Travelers can also choose their preferred travel style and budget range based on their needs.

### Administrators

Administrators can manage destination information, update travel recommendations, and track user feedback efficiently. They have access to user preferences through the admin dashboard and can communicate with users through the platform. Administrators can also maintain the platform's content, including destination information and documentation, ensuring accuracy and trust within the community.
